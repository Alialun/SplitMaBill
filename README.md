# Split'Ma'Bill
This little project was made for me and my colleagues since we order food together quite often and it's a nuisance to calculate how much you're supposed to pay.

Feel free to use it in any way you want. Don't worry, everything is stored purely in local storage so your data is perfectly safe.

You can also fork if you want of course, but please keep the original credits in the footer (you can append your stuff after it), thank you!

Thanks for visiting my repository! kthxbye!
